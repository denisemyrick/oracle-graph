# PGX Samples

PGX (Parallel Graph AnalytiX) is a graph toolkit that provides a graph query language, optimized analytics algorithms, and machine learning support to extract insights hidden in the connections across datasets at high-performance and extreme scale.

While graphs have become ubiquitous nowadays as the backbone of multiple applications - from search engines and recommender systems to intelligent chatbots, PGX enables fast graph analysis on such industry-scale graphs (with trillions of edges) to reveal latent information between linked entities.
